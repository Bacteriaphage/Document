chapter 1.
  Three important factors for a system: reliability, scalability, maintainability
  Reliablity: 
    fault vs failure: single component/user/etc. can make fault, if that cause whole system down, that's a failure.
    We can deliberately introduce fault to system to make it resilient/fault-tolerant.
    idealy, we better reduce faults in each component, but in reality, we have to deal with them.
    Hardware error: add redundancy or have software to handle faults
    Software error: hard to find, can cause cascading failures, better to carefully think when design, thorough testing, allowing crash and restart
                    monitoring, analyzing system behavior in production. Look for guarantee like sum check, sequence check to make self check.
    Human error: human error is the leading cause of outage comparing to software and hardware. We need to design system in a way that easy for 
                 human to do the right thing instead of the wrong thing, which refer to a well API design, a user-friendly UI etc.
                 Sandbox is important for detacting human error. Thoroughly test at all levels, Quick and easy recovery(rollback)
                 Monitoring, good management practice.
